# 2830FinalProject

To run, you should only need the live server extension downloaded in VisualStudio Code. 
Once you've downloaded the extension, there should be a buttom on the bottom right of the
window that says "Go Live". Click it and open the port in a web browser and you should be 
able to view the page.
